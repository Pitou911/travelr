    description: `Angkor Wat is a temple complex in northwest Cambodia. A national symbol and sacred site of Cambodian Buddhism, the complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a significant tourist destination. Angkor Wat is the largest religious complex 
        in the world by land area, measuring 162.6 hectares or more than three times the area of the Vatican City. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of four towers surrounding a central spire that rises to a height of 65 m above the ground.
        The temple has three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. It lies within an outer wall 3.6 kilometres long and a moat more than five kilometres long. The temple was built in the early 12th century at the behest of Suryavarman II 
        of the Khmer Empire, within the imperial capital Ya≈õodharapura. It served as the state temple for the empire. Originally dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu, it was converted to a Buddhist temple towards the end of the 12th century. 
        Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology.`,

    description: `The Bayon is a richly decorated Khmer Buddhist temple at Angkor in Cambodia. Built in the late 12th or early 13th century as the state temple of the Mahayana Buddhist King Jayavarman VII, the Bayon stands at the centre of Jayavarman's capital,
      Angkor Thom. Following Jayavarman's death, it was modified and augmented by subsequent Hindu and Theravada Buddhist kings in accordance with their own religious preferences. The Bayon's most distinctive feature is the multitude of serene
      and smiling stone faces on the many towers which jut out from the upper terrace and cluster around its central peak. These faces have been associated with the Hindu God Brahma because of the four faces looking in different directions but
      archaeologists also associate it with Buddha despite the jewelry, crown marking which are not associated with Buddha. The temple has two sets of bas-reliefs, which present a combination of mythological, historical, and mundane scenes.
      The main conservatory body, the Japanese Government Team for the Safeguarding of Angkor has described the temple as "the most striking expression of the baroque style" of Khmer architecture, as contrasted with the classical style of Angkor Wat`,

    description: `Phnom Bakheng is a Hindu and Buddhist temple in the form of a temple mountain in Siem Reap Province, Cambodia. Dedicated to Shiva, it was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman. Located atop a hill, it is nowadays a popular tourist spot for sunset views of the much bigger temple Angkor Wat, which lies amid the jungle about 1.5 km to the southeast. The large number of visitors makes Phnom Bakheng one of the most threatened monuments of Angkor. Since 2004, World Monuments Fund has been working to conserve the temple in partnership with APSARA.`,
